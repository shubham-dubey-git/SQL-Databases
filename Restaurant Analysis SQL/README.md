# RESTAURANT ORDER ANALYSIS

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project analyzes restaurant order and menu data to uncover insights related to menu pricing, category performance, customer ordering behavior, and revenue distribution. Using SQL, key business questions were explored to support operational and menu optimization decisions.
The analysis combines two tables — menu_items and order_details — to evaluate demand patterns, item popularity, order trends, and spending behaviors.

# OBJECTIVE

Analyze menu structure, pricing, and category performance.
Examine ordering behavior and item popularity.
Identify high-value orders and revenue-driving items.
Understand trends in order volume across the available date range.

# KEY ANALYSIS AREAS

* Total number of items available on the menu.
* Least and most expensive dishes overall and within cuisine categories.
* Number of dishes in each category and average price per category.
* Order volume over time including date range and order counts.
* Items most frequently purchased and the least ordered items.
* Orders that contained the most items and how many exceeded 12 items.
* Top 5 highest-spend orders and their category composition.

# SQL INSIGHTS SUMMARY

* Identified cheapest and most expensive items across all menu categories.
* Italian category analysis showed item count and price range comparisons.
* Category-level breakdown revealed distribution of dishes and average category pricing.
* Determined the earliest and latest order dates and total orders in the time period.
* Found the orders containing the highest number of items and counted large orders (12+ items).
* Combined menu_items and order_details to determine:
* Most ordered and least ordered items.
* Most popular item categories.
* Highest-spending customers/orders and category breakdown of their spending.
